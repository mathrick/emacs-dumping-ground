Zombie Elisp Repository
-----------------------

This is a dumping ground for various bits and pieces of Emacs Lisp I've used at some point, but which I don't right now, and which I haven't or haven't yet integrated with my improved, structured config I've migrated to. It might be because they don't have ELPA packages and I haven't written the VCS plumbing yet, it might be because I haven't figured out how to integrate them cleanly with how my workflow has evolved in the meantime, it might be because I no longer have the problems they solved, or it might be because I simply can't remember what I needed them for.

Warning
-------

I give absolutely no guarantees about this repo, its contents or continued existence. While the code here is preserved because I didn't immediately think it was completely useless and I didn't prune it, it's not a useful repo on its own. It exists as an extended reminder for myself to look into X or Y. Code I decide to integrate usefully and properly into my real config will be moved over and disappear. The whole repo might if it no longer holds anything of value.
